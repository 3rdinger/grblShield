**Question:** What is a grblShield?
**Answer:** The Arduino grblShield is a complete hardware solution for Dank's CNC motion control system called grbl. 
Compatible with the Uno and other 328p versions of the Arduino development platform. (Note: grbl 0.6 is not compatible with 168-based Arduinos (nor will it ever be), and currently grbl does not support the Arduino Megas).


The current version of the grblShield is v4.  If you are looking for documentation on the grblShield be sure to checkout the [wiki](https://github.com/synthetos/grblShield/wiki).
