Welcome to the gShield project (aka grblShield).  If you just landed here and are not sure what a gShield is here is a quick summary:<br>
<br>
**The Arduino gShield** is a complete hardware solution the [grbl CNC motion control software](https://github.com/grbl/grbl). gShield/grbl is compatible with the Uno and other 328p versions of the Arduino development platform.

The gShield can also be used to run [TinyG2 on the Arduino Due](https://github.com/synthetos/g2/wiki). TinyG2 is a ARM port of the TinyG motion control system.

**The currently shipping version of the gShield is v5. If you are looking for documentation on the gShield be sure to checkout the [gShield wiki](https://github.com/synthetos/grblShield/wiki).**

**Differences between gShield v4 and [v5](https://github.com/synthetos/grblShield/wiki/gShield-v5-Notes)**
Other than price, there is almost no difference between v4 and v5. 
The v5 has added a power selection section that allows you to select if you want to run the board from 3.3 volts, 5 volts, or the voltage selected by the Arduino (IOREF). 
This was added to better support the Arduino Due and [TinyG2](https://github.com/synthetos/g2/wiki) - an ARM version of TinyG that can drive the gShield.
